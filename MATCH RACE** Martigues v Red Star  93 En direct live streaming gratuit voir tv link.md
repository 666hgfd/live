A crucial match. Red Star, 16th and in the relegation zone, must not fail against Martigues, 17th and first to be relegated, this Friday evening at the Bauer stadium for the 22nd day of L2. After 3 defeats in a row, the Audoniens stopped the bleeding last week by collecting an encouraging draw (0-0) in Grenoble (8th). But they must now improve on this point of the draw with a victory at home against the Martégaux, efficient away from home (7th best team) as evidenced by their recent victories at Paris FC (1-2) and Dunkerque (0-1) since the beginning of the year.

With a 5-point lead over the Southerners, Red Star could create a certain gap in case of success. Quentin Beunardeau, Bissenty Mendy and Rayane Doucouré are still convalescing while Eickmayer and Slimani are injured.


"It's a high-stakes match against a direct competitor for our goal of staying up. We're especially hoping for a result, it's very important to leave with points," confided Audonian coach Grégory Poirier. " We're in a situation where we're going to have a big final stretch. The club, the group and the staff are focused on the objective with good vibes. I'm expecting a big match and a victory against Martigues."
